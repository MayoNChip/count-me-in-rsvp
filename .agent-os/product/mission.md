## The Problem

### RSVP Management Chaos

Traditional RSVP collection through calls, texts, and emails creates confusion and incomplete information. Event organizers spend hours tracking down responses and updating spreadsheets, leading to inaccurate headcounts and planning difficulties.

**Our Solution:** A centralized platform where guests can easily RSVP and organizers can view real-time attendance status.

### Last-Minute Changes

Guests often need to change their attendance status but struggle to communicate updates effectively. This results in wrong catering numbers and seating arrangements.

**Our Solution:** Allow guests to update their status anytime with automatic notifications to organizers.

## Differentiators

### Real-Time Updates

Unlike traditional RSVP methods or static forms, we provide instant updates when guests respond or change their status. This results in always-accurate headcounts and better event planning.

### Simplicity First

Unlike complex event management platforms, we focus solely on RSVP management with an intuitive interface. This results in higher response rates and less confusion for both organizers and guests.
