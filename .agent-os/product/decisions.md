## 2025-08-15: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

Building "Count Me In" as a modern RSVP management platform for personal events, starting with the developer's own wedding. The product will focus on simplicity and real-time updates, targeting event organizers who need a streamlined way to manage guest responses. Core features include event creation, guest management, RSVP collection with Yes/No/Maybe options, and a real-time status dashboard.

### Context

Traditional RSVP management through texts, calls, and emails is chaotic and time-consuming. As a developer planning their own wedding, there's a clear need for a simple, modern solution that provides real-time visibility into guest attendance. The market has complex event management platforms, but lacks focused, simple RSVP-only solutions.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Using existing event platforms (Eventbrite, Facebook Events)**
   - Pros: Established, feature-rich, no development needed
   - Cons: Overly complex, not customizable, privacy concerns, includes unnecessary features

2. **Google Forms or similar survey tools**
   - Pros: Free, quick to set up
   - Cons: No real-time updates, poor UX, no guest management, lacks professional appearance

3. **Traditional paper RSVPs**
   - Pros: Formal, traditional
   - Cons: Slow, expensive, hard to track, no ability to update responses

### Rationale

Building a custom solution allows for:
- Complete control over user experience and simplicity
- Real-time features critical for accurate planning
- Privacy and data ownership
- Opportunity to create a reusable product for others
- Technical learning with modern stack (Next.js 15, Tailwind v4)

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Streamlined RSVP process for the wedding
- Reusable product for future events
- Portfolio piece demonstrating full-stack development
- Potential to help other event organizers

**Negative:**
- Development time investment
- Hosting and maintenance costs
- Need to handle production reliability for own wedding

## 2025-08-15: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Adopt Next.js 15 with Tailwind CSS v4, Supabase for backend, shadcn/ui for components, and TanStack Query for state management. Deploy on Vercel with Supabase cloud for database.

### Context

Need a modern, performant stack that allows rapid development while maintaining production reliability. The wedding date creates a hard deadline, so proven technologies with good documentation are essential.

### Rationale

- **Next.js 15**: Latest features, excellent DX, built-in optimizations
- **Tailwind v4**: New CSS-first approach, better performance
- **Supabase**: Instant backend with real-time capabilities
- **shadcn/ui**: High-quality components without lock-in
- **TanStack Query**: Robust server state management
- **Vercel**: Zero-config deployment with excellent Next.js integration

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Rapid development with modern tools
- Built-in real-time capabilities via Supabase
- Excellent performance and SEO from Next.js
- Type safety throughout the stack

**Negative:**
- Learning curve for Tailwind v4 (new version)
- Vendor lock-in with Supabase
- Potential costs as usage scales
