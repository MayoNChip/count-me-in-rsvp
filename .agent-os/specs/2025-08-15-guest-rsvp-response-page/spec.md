# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Guest RSVP Response Page
> Created: 2025-08-15
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a secure, user-friendly RSVP response page that allows invited guests to confirm their attendance for events. This feature will provide the guest-facing interface that complements the existing admin guest management system.

## User Stories

### Guest RSVP Submission

As an invited guest, I want to access my personalized RSVP link and easily submit my attendance response, so that the event organizer knows whether I'll be attending.

The guest receives a unique link via email or text, clicks it to access their personalized RSVP page showing event details (name, date, time, location), and selects their response (Yes/No/Maybe) with optional additional guests and personal message.

### Guest Response Updates

As a guest who already responded, I want to update my RSVP status if my plans change, so that the organizer has accurate attendance information.

The guest can revisit their RSVP link to see their current response status and modify their answer, number of guests, or message until a specified cutoff date.

### Event Information Display

As a guest, I want to see clear event details on the RSVP page, so that I can make an informed decision about my attendance.

The RSVP page displays the event name, date, time, location, description, and any special instructions in an attractive, mobile-friendly format.

## Spec Scope

1. **Secure Token-Based Access** - Validate guest tokens and prevent unauthorized access
2. **Responsive RSVP Form** - Mobile-first design with clear event information display
3. **Response Options** - Support Yes/No/Maybe responses with guest count selection
4. **Update Capability** - Allow guests to modify their responses before deadline
5. **Confirmation Page** - Show success message and response summary after submission

## Out of Scope

- Email/SMS invitation sending (will be handled in separate notification spec)
- Event creation and management (already completed in admin system)
- Payment integration for paid events
- Social sharing features

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional RSVP Page** - Guest can access via unique URL and submit response successfully
2. **Mobile Responsive** - Page works perfectly on mobile devices and tablets
3. **Data Validation** - All form inputs are validated and errors handled gracefully
