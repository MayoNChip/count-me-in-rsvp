# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Invitation Image Display
> Created: 2025-08-17
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement the ability for event organizers to upload a custom invitation image (such as a wedding invitation card) that displays prominently on the RSVP page above the event message. This feature enhances the guest experience by providing visual context and personal branding that makes the RSVP process feel more connected to the actual invitation they received.

## User Stories

### Event Organizer Story

As an event organizer, I want to upload my custom invitation image to the RSVP page, so that guests see the same beautiful design they received and feel more connected to my event.

When creating or editing an event, the organizer can upload an invitation image (JPG, PNG, or WebP) up to 5MB in size. The image will be displayed at the top of the guest RSVP page, above the event details and RSVP form. The organizer can preview how the invitation will appear to guests and can update or remove the image at any time.

### Guest Experience Story

As a guest visiting an RSVP link, I want to see the event invitation image, so that I immediately recognize the event and feel the personal touch of the organizer.

When a guest visits their unique RSVP link, they first see the uploaded invitation image prominently displayed, followed by the event details and response form. This creates a cohesive experience from receiving the physical/digital invitation to completing the RSVP online.

## Spec Scope

1. **Image Upload Interface** - Admin interface to upload invitation images during event creation/editing
2. **Image Storage & Management** - Store images securely with proper file validation and size limits
3. **RSVP Page Display** - Show invitation image prominently on guest-facing RSVP pages
4. **Image Optimization** - Automatic resizing and format optimization for web display
5. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Ensure invitation images display well on all device sizes

## Out of Scope

- Advanced image editing tools (cropping, filters, etc.)
- Multiple invitation images per event
- Gallery or carousel functionality
- Image templates or design tools
- Social media integration with images

## Expected Deliverable

1. Event organizers can upload an invitation image when creating or editing events
2. Uploaded images are automatically optimized and stored securely
3. Guest RSVP pages display the invitation image prominently above the event details
