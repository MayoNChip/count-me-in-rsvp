## Overview

Implement WhatsApp invitation sending functionality that allows event organizers to send RSVP invitations directly via WhatsApp with personalized messages and secure RSVP links.

## User Stories

### Send Individual WhatsApp Invitation

As an event organizer, I want to send a WhatsApp invitation to a guest with their personalized RSVP link, so that they can easily respond without needing to check email.

The organizer selects a guest from the guest list, clicks "Send WhatsApp", and a pre-formatted message with the RSVP link opens in WhatsApp Web/App for immediate sending.

### Bulk WhatsApp Invitations

As an event organizer, I want to send WhatsApp invitations to multiple guests at once, so that I can quickly notify all guests who have phone numbers.

The organizer selects multiple guests, chooses "Send WhatsApp Invitations", and each guest's WhatsApp opens sequentially with their personalized message and RSVP link.

### Custom WhatsApp Message

As an event organizer, I want to customize the WhatsApp message template, so that I can add personal touches and event-specific information.

The system provides a customizable message template with placeholders for guest name, event details, and RSVP link that the organizer can modify before sending.

## Spec Scope
